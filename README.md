# Bitchmark
[Bitchmark](http://www.bitchmark.me) is an open sourced bookmarking app written in Rails 4.1.2 heavily using backbone.js

### Why, God Why?
There's a billion bookmarking apps out there, why do we need another?

Well, we don't really. Bitchmark started when I had too many tabs open on my browser and wanted to clean them up but not loose them entirely. And I wanted to be able to categorize them. I built the first version of Bitchmark in about 2 hours.

After using it for a few months I realized I wanted a bookmarklet as well, as it was a pain going back to the site constantly to add new bookmarks.

So to answer the question, we don't really need one. But bitchmark is dead simple (it doesn't even use authentication, just a SHA cookie) and it just stores bookmarks in "folders".

It's open source so if you like feel free to add any features you wish it had.
